## **Course Overview**
This course introduces basic programming concepts using Python. It covers topics such as:
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions
- File handling
- Error handling
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of these key concepts through practical assignments and projects.

## **Projects Included**
Below is a list of the main projects and exercises covered in this repository:
1. **Hello World and Basic Syntax.ipynb** - An introduction to Python syntax and the classic "Hello World" program.
2. **Variables and Data Types.ipynb** - Practice using variables and different data types like integers, floats, and strings.
3. **Control Flow (Loops and Conditionals).ipynb** - Exercises using loops (for, while) and conditionals (if, else, elif).
4. **Functions.ipynb** - A collection of exercises on defining and using functions, including parameter passing and return values.
5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).ipynb** - Introduction to OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
6. **Final Project - Simple Inventory Management System.ipynb** - A project that implements a basic inventory management system using Python.
